=head1 Welcome to RPTools!

The L<RPTools|http://www.rptools.net/> family of RPG software
products includes five applications.  Our goal is provide software
that helps you enjoy interactive gaming with HUMANS instead of with
COMPUTERS!

Many of us grew up playing various games.  It might be B<Monopoly>
or B<Risk>, maybe B<Pictionary> or B<Trivial Pursuit>, or perhaps
a role-playing game like B<Dungeons and Dragons> or B<Traveller>.
But as we got older our friends left the area and the games we played to
socialize and entertain ourselves fell by the wayside as we got caught
up in the rat race.

No more!  We have software that will help you bring back those long-ago
friendships and start having fun again!  A quick overview of all five
applications appears below, but the rest of the document is focused on
the one you've just downloaded:  B<MapTool>.

=head2 Overview of RPTools Applications

=over 4

=item * MapTool - virtual tabletop gaming application

B<MapTool> is an online, multiplayer, programmable, interactive, and
cross-platform application that allows collaborative gaming such as
role-playing games, boardgames, card games, dice games, and much more.

It has been translated into many languages and new translations are
submitted by our users all the time.  As of this writing the
included languages are English (the primary one), Spanish, French,
German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, and Chinese.

=item * TokenTool - digital gaming token creation tool

B<TokenTool> is a simple graphical program for creating "tokens", digital
versions of miniatures that can be used with B<MapTool> or any other
virtual tabletop application, such as B<Roll20> and B<d20Pro>.

=item * CharacterTool - character management tool

B<CharTool> is a character management tool.  It will manage all
aspects of character creation and advancement for those game systems
which have a template available.  Seasoned users can create their own
templates to add to the available game systems or create their
own unique system.

=item * InitiativeTool - initiative tracker (mostly for combat encounters)

B<InitTool> will manage the turn-by-turn sequencing that many game systems
use.  Characters can be created in B<CharTool> and dragged into
B<InitTool> when needed.

=item * DiceTool - feature-rich dice-rolling application

B<DiceTool> is a (not so) simple dice rolling application.  Users can
develop their own custom dice rolling functions and implement any dice
rolling scheme they can think up!  B<DiceTool> comes preloaded with a
variety of game systems already implemented.

=head2 Where to find more information

One of our forum users, B<brad>, has put together a series of a
dozen or so short screencast videos.  They are categorized first
by who is most likely to use them, players or the game master.  A
second level of categorization involves functionality:  what do you
want to do?  The videos are generally short, none are more than 8-9
minutes, and are narrated so that each part of the graphical interface
is explained.  You can find them on the
L<Tutorials|https://www.rptools.net/tutorials/> page on our
main web site.

We suggest you start on the L<FAQ|http://www.rptools.net/?page=faq>
page of our web site for basic questions.  For more involved questions
you may want to register on L<our forums|http://forums.rptools.net/>
where you can search for others who have experienced the problem (and
likely find your solution) or start a new thread with your own question.
(Please do search though, as it helps us keep the forums from having
many repetitive threads on the same topic!)

If you choose to ask your question on our forum, please include the
output generated when you use the B<Help> E<gt> B<Gather System Info...>
option from the B<MapTool> menu.  There is information there that is
important in helping us diagnose the problem you're having.  (Some
people like to redact portions of the output.  Just be aware that some
parts of it are important and removing portions of it might mean you
won't get your problem solved.)

=head2 Requirements

All of the RPTools applications are programmed in Java and can be used
on any platform supporting Java 6 or later.  Specifics on where to find
Java for your platform are available at http://www.java.com/

We have tried to remain as compatible as possible with Java 6; in
fact, we believe B<MapTool 1.3.b90> works great in Java 6.  But there
are no guarantees that B<MapTool> will work correctly in Java
versions older than Java 7.  And as time goes on the RPTools team
will continue to move applications to later versions.

B<MapTool> requires at least 256MB of memory for itself.  This number is
NOT the amount of physical memory in the machine, but is the amount of
memory needed just by this application.  Larger memory sizes will allow
for larger, more intricate maps.

Because Java was initially developed for standalone applications, it
requires that upper and lower memory limits be set when Java
applications are executed.  We have provided a graphical configuration
tool to help with this called B<MapTool Launcher>, or just B<MTL> for short.
A full description of how to choose memory settings is beyond the scope
of this document, but you can find more information on our forums in the
L<MapTool|http://forums.rptools.net/viewforum.php?f=3> category.

=head2 Starting the application

There are two ways to start B<MapTool> (or any of the RPTools
applications):

=over 4

=item 1 Java Web Start

You can visit the L<Launch page|http://www.rptools.net/?page=launch> of
our main web site and choose the application you want to run from the
table.  Memory sizes can be set on that same page, if needed.

This approach has two advantages.  First, after you click the
link you will be downloading a configuration file called a B<JNLP> file.
This contains references back to our web site as well as all of the
configuration options you choose, if any.  You can email this file as an
attachment to your friends and when they activate it they will get the
same exact configuration for the application that you get.  This is the
most reliable way to ensure all applications are configured the same.

The second advantage is that you don't need to have Internet access when
you want to run the programs in the future.  The first time you launch
an application it will be downloaded to your machine and saved.
Thereafter when you run the JNLP file it will execute the application
out of the cache.

This approach can optionally create a desktop icon for you to make it
easier to launch the application in the future, but you can turn this
off or delete the icon without harm; the application is still stored in
the cache and will still execute from there.

=item 1 Download an Archive

You can also visit the
L<Downloads page|http://www.rptools.net/?page=downloads>
and download the ZIP (Windows and Linux) or DMG (Mac OS X) version
of the application.  (Stay away from ones marked B<broken>.  Those
were released and then later found to have one or more issues that
make them unsuitable for most users.)

=over 8

=item 1 Windows and Linux

For these operating systems you want to download the ZIP archive.

Unpack the ZIP file somewhere on your computer -- do not try to run
the application from inside the ZIP file because it won't work!
When you extract the contents be sure to extract full directory names.
Some files stored in the archive are in subdirectories and the
application won't work correctly unless that structure is preserved.

Once unpacked, you can navigate to that folder (a.k.a. "directory")
and double-click the B<MapTool Launcher> file to start it.  As of the
time of this writing, the file to activate would be
B<launcher-130725.01.jar> (that version number gives the release
date in YYMMDD format and the build number).

The B<MapTool Launcher> has its own documentation.  Look in the B<doc>
subdirectory for the HowTo guide.

=item 1 Mac OS X

If you're lucky enough to be using a Mac (!) then you may
choose the DMG file instead.  It is a disk image designed to integrate
into the OS X environment.  Just double-click it and then drag the
application bundle where you want it installed on your computer.
You can now double-click the application just like any other OS X
application.  As described in the L<Windows and Linux> section, above,
the documentation for the B<MapTool Launcher> is available as part of the
bundle.  You will need to right-click the application and choose
I<Show package contents> and then look inside B<Contents/MacOS/doc> for
the HowTo guide.

=head2 Using the Application

The best place to find information on B<MapTool> is our web site.  Start at
the L<Tutorial page|http://rptools.net/?page=tutorial> and check out the
screencasts created by one of our forum users.  They are very helpful!
Try out the things you see in the screencast while the video is playing
and don't be afraid to pause the video or rewind it.  The author moves
at a pretty good clip because he knows you can pause!

You'll also find L<our forums|http://forums.rptools.net/> to be an
excellent place to ask questions and receive answers.  We have a very
large community of people willing to share their experiences on
technical issues as well as big picture questions regarding how to use
B<MapTool>.

=head2 Summary

That's it!  Thank you for joining us at RPTools and we hope you have a
successful foray into the world of online virtual gaming!
